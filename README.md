# RelationalAlgebraParser (RAP)

### Introduction
This is a prototype relational algebra tool for parsing simple markdown into relational algebra formatting for exporting to Word documents, Power point presentations etc.

Disclaimer: this tool is just a prototype, and so there is no support or guarantee of accuracy in terms of the output.

### Running the app
Simply download the .html file, and open in your preferred browser. 

Look at the examples (in app) for more information on using simple keywords to represent common operators, and copy the output to your chosen editor (remember to preserve the output to render subscripted sequences correctly).
